Two-dimensional boundary element solver

Solves the 2D Laplace equation on a circular surface using
using the Boundary Integral Method. The boundary conditions are specified
as Dirichlet on one half of the boundary and as Neumann condition on the
other half.
The algorithm to used for the solution is used from the book by Why-Teong Ang
